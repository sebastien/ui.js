"""
Give an log entry format like so:
- level: one of "debug", "log", "warning", "error"
- message: a description of the error message, for instance "Invalid input"
- structured data for the context, for instance `{Value:"asdad12312dasd", Application:"Web API",Environment:"Production"}`
- timestamp: an EPOCH UTC timestamp in seconds (float)

Could you generate 20 sample entries or more in JSON format that would be representative of a log journal of a web application backend? Try to have an example for each in JSON format, and make the UTC timestamp start in 2024
