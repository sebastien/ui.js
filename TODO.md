## Roadmap

-   `[ ]` Implement component lifecycle (create, update, delete)

-   `[ ]` Implement granular data update operations (create, update,
    delete, insert, remove, swap)

## Design

-   State: do we have a state tree for components (the component
    hierarchy) and one for data? I guess the answer is yes, as they can
    be orthogonal.
